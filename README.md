This is my discord bot, instructions on how to get it working are below.

First off, you need to get node and npm, to install them goto https://nodejs.org and download either the newest version or get the recommended version, it doesn't matter, and install it. After that, you need to run in a terminal in the master directory of the bot, ``npm install discord.io winston`` and let install, proceeding that you will need to create a file called .auth.json and the contents of it will be `{ "token": "<BOT TOKEN>" }`except replace <BOT TOKEN> with your bot's token. Then after that is done, you need to open a terminal or cmd window and navigate to the folder that you clone this repo to, and type node bot.js and it should be running!
